Aloha, my name is Brittany Cinense and I am majoring in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawaii. It has been a long journey for me to decide what I really wanted to pursue as a career, but I am happy to finally settle on my pathway on a MIS career. I had first started to pursue a degree in Nursing, but found that I love the connections to technology and the bridge that connects that technology with people to improve in every way. I am looking forward to learning more in-depth about MIS and the tools I can use for the future. On my spare time I love gaming, staying active and reading historical novels.
